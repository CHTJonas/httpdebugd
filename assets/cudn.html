      This page will report your IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as seen by servers both inside and outside the
      <a href="https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/service/network-services/datanetwork">Cambridge University Data Network</a>.
      This is provided on a "best-effort" basis in the hope that it will be useful for those who use split-tunnel VPNs.
      You will need to have JavaScript enabled for this to work.
